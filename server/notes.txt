sameSite: "none": This option sets the SameSite attribute of the cookie to "none".

By setting it to "none", the cookie can be sent with cross-site requests, which is often 
required for scenarios like Single Sign-On (SSO) across different domains.
    
secure: true: This option sets the Secure attribute of the cookie to true. The Secure 
attribute is used to ensure that the cookie is only sent over secure HTTPS connections. 
By setting it to true, the cookie will only be transmitted over HTTPS, providing an 
additional layer of security.
