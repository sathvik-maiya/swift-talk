# SwiftTalk Chat Application

SwiftTalk is a chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create accounts, log in, and engage in real-time messaging with other registered users. The application utilizes WebSocket technology for seamless and instant communication.

## Features

- User registration and login: Users can create an account with a unique username and password or log in if they already have an account.
- Real-time messaging: Users can exchange real-time messages with each other, allowing for instant communication.
- Online status: Users can see the online status of other registered users. The status is dynamically updated when users are online or offline.
- File sharing: Users can send files to other users within the chat application. The recipient can easily access and download the shared files.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js
- Axios
- WebSocket

## Folder Structure

The project folder structure is organized as follows:

- `client`: Contains the React client-side code.
- `server`: Contains the server-side code.
- `server/index.js`: The main server file.

## Installation

Before running the SwiftTalk application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js
- Nodemon
- npm

To set up the SwiftTalk application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the server folder: `cd server`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

MONGO_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<random-string>
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"

Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your actual MongoDB connection string. Generate a random string for `JWT_SECRET`.

4. Install server dependencies: `npm`
5. Start the server: `nodemon index.js`
6. Open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder: `cd client`
7. Install client dependencies: `npm`
8. Start the client: `npm dev`

The SwiftTalk application should now be up and running on your local machine.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to access the SwiftTalk application.
